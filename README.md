# Automated Regression Log Analyzer (Python)

This project implements an automated tool to simulate hardware regression testing logs and perform failure analysis using Python.

## Description
The tool generates a regression-style log file with random PASS/FAIL results for ALU, cache, and memory-related tests. It then parses the log and produces a summary report showing total tests, passed tests, failed tests, and error reasons.

This simulates how verification engineers analyze large regression logs to identify failures and debug issues.

## Features
- Regression log generation
- Automatic PASS/FAIL detection
- Failure categorization
- Summary report generation
- Debug-friendly output format

## Tools & Technologies
- Python

## How to Run
1. Run the script using:
2. Go to the project folder.
3. Run this command: python LogParser_Automated.py

## Output
- A generated regression log file
- Console report with total test results and failure details
