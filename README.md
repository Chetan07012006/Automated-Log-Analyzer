# Automated Regression Log Analyzer (Python)

This project simulates hardware regression test log generation and automated log analysis using Python.

## Description
The script generates realistic regression logs with random failures and then parses them to produce a summary report for debugging and triage. The goal is to simulate how verification engineers analyze large regression logs.

## Features
- Synthetic regression log generation
- Automatic pass/fail detection
- Error message extraction
- Report generation
- Debug-friendly formatting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python

## How to Run
